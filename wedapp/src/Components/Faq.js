            Weddings in India are a mainstay in the social calendar of the whole
            community - so it is highly unlikely that a wedding is cancelled.
            However, in case of event cancellation, the buyer is entitled to
            full refund of the contribution. To allow a smooth, calm and
            relaxing preparation of the wedding, full cancellation is only
            accepted until 30 days prior the event. In case of cancellation
            within 30 days, 50% of the contribution will be charged to the
            buyer. In case of no show up without any prior notification, the
            full contribution will be taken from the buyer’s account. No further
            penalty charges are applied. However, travelers can always decide to
            contribute to a couple’s wedding even if they cannot attend in
            person.
