                WBC relies on the following basis to legitimize the processing
                of your personal data: your voluntary consent. The personal data
                you expressly provided with the intention to be public may be
                displayed on your Site profile. Other data requested of you from
                the WBC team is only used by WBC team to assist you with your
                wedding experience. In order to allow WBC to assist you in the
                best possible way, by registering on the Site, you voluntary
                consent to that WBC processes – as data controller - the
                availability data (mobile phone number, e-mail address) that you
                provided WBC with for the purposes to connect you, in case you
                are Traveler, with the relevant Couples as your possible future
                host(s), and, in case you are Couple, to Travelers, and you
                agree that we share with them or their representative such
                information. Also, you hereby voluntary consent to that WBC uses
                any photos or media that you share with us (e.g. upload to the
                Site) in association with the Event and your WBC experience for
                direct marketing purposes, including uploading such content to
                public social media sites (such as Facebook, WeddingBellsConnect
                Site, etc). Before sharing any personal information with WBC,
                you are responsible to ask necessary permission of affected
                persons. The provision of your personal data to WBC is optional.
                However, if you do not provide all or part of your personal
                data, we may be unable to carry out the purposes for processing.
                Your voluntary consent may be withdrawn at any time, by deleting
                your registration on the Site. Of course, if you ask WBC in the
                future to remove any provided media, WBC will do so. You are
                kindly reminded that in case you withdraw your consent, WBC
                ceases to be in a position to further assist you as provided for
                on the Site. Certain data may be kept in case applicable law
                requires so or on the basis of legitimate interest, if
                applicable. WBC reserves the right to investigate and take
                appropriate legal action against anyone who, in WBC’s sole
                discretion, violates any provision of WBC or any privacy
                regulation, including without limitation, removing the offending
                content from the Service, suspending or terminating the account
                of such violators and reporting you to the law enforcement
                authorities.
